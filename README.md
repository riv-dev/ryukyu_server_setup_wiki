# Ryukyu Social Server Setup

This tutorial assumes you have a Linux server.

### Basic server setup

The first thing you need to do is set bare minimum settings for server security.  Here I will summarize quickly.  The original tutorial is here: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04)

1. Remotely log into the server with username "root" and root password.  To do this, type the following on the command line (use Terminal program on your Macbook).  You should get prompts to enter the password.
```
ssh root@server_ip_address
```
(optional) If you forgot your root password, you can reset it by logging into your Digital Ocean account, selecting your droplet, select "access", and reset root password.

2. Create a new user for your server.  In the future, you do not want to log in as "root", it is not good practice to use the "root" account.  Choose a username, for example "riv".  Type in a good password, and accept all defaults by pressing "Enter".
```
adduser riv
```

3. This new user will be the server admin.  Give your new user sudo privileges for performing administrative tasks.
```
usermod -aG sudo riv
```

4. Check if you already have a local ssh-key on your computer.  Start a new Terminal and type the following on the command line:
```
ls ~/.ssh
```
If you see "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub" it means you already have an ssh-key, you may skip step 5.  If you do not, then you don't have one yet, follow step 5.

5. Create an ssh-key on your local computer.  Start a new Terminal and type and execute the following on your local machine:
```
ssh-keygen
```
